# Hackathon Tracker

Welcome to the Hackathon Tracker! This project is a comprehensive platform designed to provide detailed information about hackathons happening in India. Our goal is to create a centralized resource for all the latest hackathon events, including key details like prize pools, locations, dates, and organizing bodies. Each hackathon entry includes a link to its official website for further information and registration.
